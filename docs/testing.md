# Testing

This document contains Tiger's test commands, verification strategy, and
pre-PR verification guidance.

## Local Tests

Official local test workflow:

```sh
ctest --preset conan-debug
ctest --preset conan-release
```

Tests are built by default. Disable them explicitly with `-DBUILD_TESTS=OFF`
only when a task does not need local test targets.

Use `ctest --preset conan-debug` after a Debug build and
`ctest --preset conan-release` after a Release build. Before considering a
change complete, prefer Release tests unless the change is Debug-specific or
Release cannot be built locally.

## Full Verification

Before considering a change complete, agents should prefer running the smallest
relevant verification command that is already documented or confirmed by the
project owner.

Preferred full Windows Release verification workflow:

```sh
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release
cmake --fresh --preset conan-default
cmake --build --preset conan-release
ctest --preset conan-release --output-on-failure
cmake --install build --config Release
```

Preferred full Linux Release verification workflow:

```sh
conan install . --build=missing -s build_type=Release
cmake --fresh --preset conan-release
cmake --build --preset conan-release
ctest --preset conan-release --output-on-failure
cmake --install build/Release
```

Run the full workflow after changes to CMake, Conan, modules, applications,
protobuf generation, tests, install behavior, or dependency configuration. For
documentation-only changes, a full build is not required. If the full workflow
is skipped, mention why in the final response or pull request notes.

## Test Framework Policy

- Use QTest for sample and project tests.
- Qt is expected as a dependency for all tests.

## Expected Verification Areas

- configure;
- build;
- test, if tests exist;
- package verification through `test_package/`, if applicable;
- formatting, if formatting is changed.

## Pre-PR Verification Checklist

- Run the relevant Debug or Release build workflow, with Release preferred
  before completion.
- Run the relevant `ctest` preset when tests exist.
- Run install verification when install or package behavior changes.
- Run `conan install` after dependency changes.

See [agent-workflow.md](agent-workflow.md) for the full pre-PR checklist and
pull request notes policy.
