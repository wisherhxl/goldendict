# GoldenDict Linux Feature-Parity Matrix

## Status Vocabulary

- `done`: implemented and verified in the Qt 6 migration.
- `mapped`: legacy behavior and ownership are identified, but code is not yet
  migrated.
- `slice`: required by the Phase 4 first-usable vertical slice.
- `later`: required for the formal Linux release but intentionally sequenced
  after the vertical slice.
- `post-linux`: restored after the Linux acceptance gate.

## Build, Packaging, And Product Identity

| Capability | Status | Target gate | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GoldenDict 1.6.0 identity | done | Phase 2 | CMake and Conan metadata |
| Qt 6.11.1 with Qt WebEngine | done | Phase 2 | clean Conan package build |
| Linux Release build/install/TGZ | done | Phase 2 | direct build and CPack |
| Conan consumer package | done | Phase 2 | `conan create` and `test_package` |
| GPL product / MIT Tiger boundary | done | Phase 2 | installed/package notices |
| Public `goldendict_core` library boundary | slice | Phase 4 | shared build, install, and exported CMake target |
| GUI depends only on application facade | slice | Phase 4 | startup and replacement atomically compose local, online, and shell-free external runtime sources behind the facade; include-boundary and focused application tests |
| AI-ready headless dictionary API | slice | Phase 4 | structured, bounded, provenance-bearing non-GUI consumer |
| Debug, runtime bundle, DEB/RPM, CI | mapped | Phase 9 | clean release matrix |

## Core Lookup Path

| Capability | Status | Target gate | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimal configuration load/persist | slice | Phase 4 | clean-profile round-trip |
| Legacy configuration migration | slice | Phase 8 | bounded one-shot XML import covers paths, groups, portable preferences, exact tab-opening preferences, opaque 64 KiB main-window geometry, all P4-supported online/external sources, exact portable/Linux/Windows/macOS legacy profile selection, and platform-specific history/favorites companion discovery; independent current precedence, deterministic no-fallback selection, per-destination atomic persistence, strict representability, secret exclusion, and untouched legacy sources are pinned; the pinned legacy application has no persisted article-session format; legacy version-1 opaque main-window state is intentionally excluded because no authentic pinned artifact or exact Qt runtime compatibility contract exists, and Windows-specific normal/maximized rectangle/window-mode migration is likewise unsupported by evidence; current Qt 6 state versions 2 through 7 are bounded and transactionally supported with rollback and semantic defaults, while the backed shell hierarchy and complete canonical File/View/Edit/Search/History/Favorites/Help menu bar are legacy-compatible |
| Dictionary path discovery | slice | Phase 4 | temporary-directory tests |
| Dictionary identity and index lifecycle | slice | Phase 4 | deterministic index tests |
| Async word/article/resource requests | slice | Phase 4 | completion/cancel/error tests |
| Exact headword lookup | slice | Phase 4 | generated StarDict fixture |
| Ranked Unicode-folded prefix lookup | slice | Phase 5 | bounded prefix ranking and installed-consumer tests |
| Unicode case/diacritic/punctuation folding | slice | Phase 5 | data-driven text and folded-lookup tests |
| Bounded legacy text encoding conversion | slice | Phase 5 | strict Latin-1, UTF-16, GB18030, and EUC-JP fixtures |
| Headword suggestions | slice | Phase 5 | bounded ranked suggestion fixtures and installed-consumer tests |
| Morphology and transliteration | later | Phase 5 | per-language fixtures |
| Full-text search | later | Phase 5/8 | index and UI workflow tests |

## Local Dictionary Formats

| Aard | slice | binary batch | bounded 32/64-bit archive indexes, zlib/bzip2/raw articles, metadata, folded lookup/suggestions, redirects, and sanitized article links; multi-volume aggregation, icons, and full-text parity remain |
| ZIM | slice | binary batch | bounded header/directory/cluster parsing, consecutive split files, raw/zlib/bzip2 clusters, 32/64-bit blob offsets, metadata, redirects, folded lookup/suggestions, and resources; LZMA2/Zstd, complex link rewriting, icons, and full-text parity remain |
| SLOB | slice | binary batch | bounded header/reference/item/bin parsing, declared text encoding, metadata tags, aliases, raw/zlib/bzip2 stores, folded lookup/suggestions, sanitized articles, and resources; LZMA2, advanced conversion, icons, and full-text parity remain |
| EPWING | slice | specialized batch | bounded `CATALOGS`/subbook/index parsing, Latin-1 and JIS X 0208 text, folded lookup/suggestions, internal references, and confined subbook resources; compressed HONMON, mixed GB2312, gaiji/media rendering, grouped indexes, and full-text parity remain |
| LSA audio archive | slice | specialized batch | bounded `.lsa`/`.dat` index and UTF-16 name parsing, folded lookup/suggestions, safe HTML5 audio references, and sample-range Vorbis-to-WAV retrieval; icons and large-file streaming remain |
| ZIP sound packs | slice | specialized batch | bounded recursive `.zips` discovery, classic central/local header validation, UTF-8/CP437 names, stored/deflated members with CRC verification, folded lookup/suggestions, sanitized HTML5 playback, and typed audio retrieval; ZIP64, encrypted/split archives, icons, and large-file streaming remain |
| Sound directories | slice | specialized batch | persistent explicit path/name configuration, bounded recursive regular-file indexing without symlink traversal, folded lookup/suggestions, sanitized HTML5 playback, and confined typed audio retrieval; icons and large-file streaming remain |

All rows above are required for the first formal Linux release. Batch names do
not authorize dropping a legacy format.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Article audio-link routing | mapped | Phase 7/9 | local media fixtures |
| Qt Multimedia playback | mapped | Phase 9 | supported codec smoke |
| FFmpeg/libao playback | mapped | Phase 9 | optional feature tests |
| External audio player | mapped | Phase 9 | controlled process test |

## User Interface And User-Owned State

| Capability | Status | Target gate | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minimal application window | done | Phase 2 | smoke test |
| Minimal lookup and article view | slice | Phase 4 | vertical-slice workflow |
| Main tabs and navigation | slice | Phase 8 | bounded lifecycle and current-format persisted session, visible retained WebEngine tabs, configurable append/after-current placement and default activation with explicit overrides, positional or symmetric runtime-only MRU keyboard traversal without persisted reordering, deterministic close behavior, synchronized state, facade-backed navigation, a legacy-compatible active-tab results-navigation pane backed only by ordered bounded lookup entries, and a cancellable per-tab prefix-suggestion pane backed only by the existing bounded suggestion service; the pinned legacy application has no persisted article-session format to migrate |
| Dictionary/group controls | slice | Phase 8 | config round-trip, ordered catalog-resolved lookup/suggestion/article filtering, visible all/configured-group selector, bounded ordered group/member/metadata/muting editor, and a legacy-compatible ephemeral per-group `dictionaryBar` whose visible checks filter lookup and suggestions without configuration mutation |
| Preferences and source editor | slice | Phase 8 | source editing and the backed General controls for tab placement/activation, hide-single-tab, MRU traversal, ESC hiding with child/modal precedence, article double-click translation and single-click selection through an isolated bounded WebEngine boundary, history, Favorites deletion, article collapsing, input limits, diacritics, synonyms, DSL optional parts, and credential-free manual HTTP CONNECT proxying for every configured HTTP and raw-TCP DICT source are accepted through atomic complete-candidate coverage; all five ready Preferences leaves are complete, while Preferences as a whole remains open; languages/appearance, tray/autostart, hotkeys/scan, audio, full text, unsupported proxy modes, dictionary-reference context navigation, updates, and cache policy retain explicit Phase 5/6/7/9 prerequisites, including a Phase 7 network-cache ownership audit; delayed history/Favorites saves, WebKit plugins, optional cross-site weakening, unapproved header suppression, Windows scan technologies, and non-dialog legacy fields are intentionally excluded with documented evidence |
| History | slice | Phase 8 | bounded UTF-8/group-aware current store, legacy line-format migration, current-state precedence, atomic persistence, visible group selection with missing-group fallback, group-preserving lookup recording and activation, filtering, clear, import, export, and a reusable pane |
| Favorites | slice | Phase 8 | bounded hierarchical current store, strict legacy XML migration, current-state precedence, atomic persistence, reusable tree pane, root/selected-folder add, nested folder creation, item/folder rename, sibling reordering, arbitrary entry/subtree cross-folder move, move-to-root and removal, re-lookup, and bounded legacy-compatible XML import/export |
| Dictionary info/headword browser | slice | Phase 8 | facade-backed catalog identity, redacted source, language, count, and selectable plain-text description display for metadata-bearing migrated formats; copy-source/open-containing-folder actions, bounded per-dictionary prefix, wildcard, and regular-expression filtering, lookup activation, atomic complete single-dictionary headword export through bounded enumeration, and fixture-backed UI smokes; R3a.1-R3a.3 provide authenticated bounded full-list enumeration for StarDict, 11 article formats, LSA, sound directories, and ZIP sounds, and R3b streams that enumeration to a legacy-compatible UTF-8 text file |
| Scan popup | mapped | Phase 9 | X11 and Wayland behavior |
| Global hotkeys | mapped | Phase 9 | X11 and Wayland behavior |
| Clipboard/selection lookup | mapped | Phase 9 | X11 and Wayland behavior |
| Tray integration | mapped | Phase 9 | desktop smoke test |

Legacy configuration, groups, history, and favorites must not be silently
discarded. Migration may normalize representation only with tested read/upgrade
behavior and a recoverable failure path.

## Formal Linux Release Gate

The first formal Linux release requires all `slice`, `mapped`, and `later`
Linux rows above to pass. Only `post-linux` rows may remain incomplete. Any
intentional behavior difference from legacy commit `3d93dd66` requires a
documented rationale and explicit review.
