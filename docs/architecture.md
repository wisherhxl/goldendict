# Architecture

This document describes GoldenDict's Tiger-based repository structure, project
layout rules, and design rationale. `AGENTS.md` stays short and links here for
details.

## Project Purpose

GoldenDict is a cross-platform dictionary lookup application. The migration
uses Tiger's reusable CMake and Conan 2 structure on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Tiger owns module and application conventions, Conan dependency integration,
installation layout, and generated project configuration files. GoldenDict
owns product identity and behavior. See [migration.md](migration.md).

## Supported Platforms And Toolchains

Supported operating systems:

- Linux.
- Windows.
- macOS.

Supported compiler families:

- MSVC 2019 or newer.
- GCC 9.1 or newer.
- Clang/LLVM 8.0 or newer.

For now, treat macOS compiler support under the Clang/LLVM policy instead of
maintaining a separate AppleClang minimum version.

## Repository Structure

- `apps/`: application targets.
- `apps/<app_name>/resources/`: optional application resource directory for
  runtime files such as configs, images, and other assets. `TigerApp.cmake`
  copies its contents to the app binary directory after build when resource
  copying is enabled.
- `modules/`: reusable project modules.
- `cmake/`: shared CMake logic, templates, checks, and packaging helpers.
- `cmake_finders/`: project CMake finder modules for Conan dependencies.
- `conan/recipes/`: narrowly scoped local recipes for dependencies unavailable
  from configured Conan remotes.
- `profiles/`: project Conan profiles for dependency build requirements.
- `test_package/`: Conan package verification project.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: root CMake entry point.
- `conanfile.py`: Conan recipe for configuring, building, and packaging.
- `VERSION`: project version source.

See [coding-style.md](coding-style.md) for concrete module, application,
proto, and generated-file layout rules.

## Module Design

Tiger separates public shared-library modules from runnable applications.
GoldenDict initially uses one product library, `goldendict_core`, while
`apps/goldendict` contains presentation and the composition root only.

The planned dependency spine is:

```text
apps/goldendict GUI ----------> desktop application facade --+
                                                             |
future dictionary service ---> headless dictionary API ------+-> goldendict_core
                                                             |
future transport adapter -----> transport-neutral DTOs ------+

goldendict_core contains private application/domain, dictionary-format,
article, configuration, and infrastructure components.
```

The internal components preserve dependency inversion and focused tests
without creating a public ABI for each layer or dictionary format. The
headless API supports discovery, indexing, lookup, article/resource retrieval,
cancellation, and lifecycle without Qt Widgets, Qt Gui, or Qt WebEngine. It
does not choose HTTP, gRPC, JSON, or another future service transport.

Consumers inject a `CoreConfiguration` containing dictionary roots and the
generated-index directory. `LoadConfiguration` treats a missing file as a
clean profile, while `SaveConfiguration` persists the same bounded,
versioned schema. `CreateDictionaryService` is the headless composition entry
point and `CreateDesktopFacade` is the presentation-facing entry point. Both
compose private format adapters inside `goldendict_core`; neither exposes a
StarDict type. Synchronous lookup is available for simple headless consumers,
and `StartLookup` returns an owned request with explicit completion and
cancellation whose lifetime does not depend on the service object.

Built-in local formats are composed behind the same private backend contract.
StarDict owns its generated index and typed resource adapter. Dictd consumes
the original `.index` plus `.dict` or `.dict.dz` files directly, including the
optional original-headword column and `00databaseshort` title metadata. Dictd
articles enter the common inert article assembler as untrusted plain text;
legacy presentation-specific phonetic and cross-reference markup remains an
article-phase concern rather than format discovery behavior.

SDict consumes original `.dct` containers directly. Its private adapter
validates the packed little-endian header, full-index chain, headword UTF-8,
and article ranges before exposing entries. Plain, zlib, and bzip2 fields are
decompressed under explicit output limits; legacy structural tags and word
references are converted to the common sanitized-HTML and typed-link path.

XDXF consumes original `.xdxf` XML and gzip-compatible `.xdxf.dz` files
directly through a bounded Expat stream parser. The private adapter preserves
dictionary and language metadata, maps logical XDXF markup and word references
into the common sanitized-HTML path, and resolves bounded resources from safe
relative paths beside the dictionary or below its `.files` directory. Resource
ZIP archives and full-text indexes remain later parity increments.

GLS consumes original `.gls` and gzip-compatible `.gls.dz` glossaries. The
private adapter strictly decodes UTF-8, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE input under
explicit size limits, preserves title/language metadata and alternate
headwords, and sends glossary HTML through the common sanitizer. Resource
reads are confined to safe relative paths beside the glossary or below its
`.files` directory. Resource ZIP archives and full-text indexes remain later
parity increments.

ABBYY Lingvo DSL consumes original `.dsl` and gzip-compatible `.dsl.dz` files;
companion `_abrv` files are not exposed as standalone dictionaries. The
private adapter strictly decodes BOM-marked UTF-8/UTF-16 and declared
Windows-1250/1251/1252 input, preserves name and language directives, expands
bounded optional headword parts and tildes, and converts common DSL markup,
word links, and image references into the common sanitized article path.
Resource reads are confined to safe relative paths beside the dictionary or
under either applicable `.files` directory. Abbreviation expansion, resource
ZIP archives, nested cards, and full-text indexes remain later parity work.

Babylon BGL consumes original `.bgl` containers. The private adapter strictly
validates the Babylon signature, embedded gzip stream, variable-width block
lengths, entry ranges, and aggregate output limits before exposing data. It
preserves title and language metadata, decodes UTF-8 and the common Babylon
legacy code pages through the shared encoding primitive, exposes alternate
headwords through folded lookup and suggestions, and keeps embedded resources
behind the typed resource API. Definitions enter the common sanitizer as
untrusted HTML. Advanced transcription/control records, historical Hebrew
repairs, and full-text indexes remain later parity work.

MDict consumes 2.x `.mdx` dictionaries and their `.mdd`, `.1.mdd`, and later
resource volumes. The private adapter validates UTF-16 header XML and checksums,
bounds key/record tables and all decompression, strictly decodes declared text,
applies embedded stylesheet markers, resolves bounded article redirects, and
serves normalized MDD resource names through the typed resource API. Plain and
zlib blocks are supported in this slice; encrypted dictionaries, LZO blocks,
older 1.x containers, local-file resource fallback, and full-text indexes
remain explicit parity work.

Aard consumes `.aar` archive volumes through a private bounded adapter. It
validates the fixed header and 32/64-bit index layouts, decompresses metadata
and articles with bzip2 or zlib (while accepting legacy raw article payloads),
strictly validates UTF-8 headwords and JSON strings, exposes folded lookup and
suggestions, and rewrites Aard word/redirect links into the common typed lookup
path before sanitization. Multi-volume aggregation, icon sidecars, and
full-text indexes remain explicit parity work.

ZIM consumes single `.zim` archives and consecutive split volumes beginning at
`.zimaa` through a private bounded adapter. It validates the fixed header,
MIME, URL, directory, cluster, and 32/64-bit blob-offset tables; resolves
bounded redirects; exposes metadata, folded article lookup and suggestions;
and serves namespaced binary resources through the typed resource API. Raw,
zlib, and bzip2 clusters are supported in this slice. LZMA2/Zstd clusters,
complex relative-link rewriting, icon conversion, and full-text indexes remain
explicit parity work.

SLOB consumes `.slob` containers through a private bounded adapter. It
validates the magic, declared encoding, metadata tags, content types,
reference/item/bin offset tables, and decompressed lengths; supports aliases,
folded lookup and suggestions, and serves non-article bins through the typed
resource API. Raw, zlib, and bzip2 item stores are supported in this slice.
LZMA2, advanced content conversion, icons, and full-text indexes remain
explicit parity work.

Lookup normalization is a private foundation concern. Backends compare a
canonical Unicode form that applies compatibility normalization, full case
folding, diacritic removal, and whitespace/punctuation folding. Public results
retain the dictionary's original headword and expose the canonical form only as
transport-neutral match metadata, so GUI and future AI-service adapters share
identical lookup semantics.

The headless lookup request supports bounded prefix matching through
`MatchMode::kPrefix`. A separate `Suggest` operation returns lightweight
headwords and match metadata without reading or assembling article bodies.
Prefix ranking is core behavior: canonical exact matches come first, followed
by shorter canonical candidates with deterministic scores. Neither the GUI nor
a future AI transport reimplements folding, ranking, limits, cancellation, or
dictionary traversal.

Legacy text encoding is also a private foundation concern. Format adapters use
one bounded, strict UTF-8 conversion primitive rather than Qt GUI-era codec
objects or format-local conversion loops. The primitive supports both decoding
dictionary payloads and encoding query text, rejects substitution on malformed
or unrepresentable data, and keeps ICU types out of public headers.

`main.cpp` may wire a future optional integration module into the core
extension contracts; other GUI code must not include adapter headers.

Another product DLL is justified only by a real deployment boundary such as
optional dependencies, platform isolation, or plugin loading. Network, audio,
and desktop integration are evaluated against that rule when their phases
begin instead of being pre-split speculatively.

Phase 2 retains Tiger's base module as build infrastructure and the minimal
GoldenDict application shell. Phase 4 introduces `goldendict_core`.

## AI Dictionary Service Compatibility

The future service is an AI retrieval surface, not a remote copy of the GUI.
Its adapter may use MCP, HTTP, gRPC, or another protocol, but those transports
map onto the same headless core contract.

The contract is designed around:

- dictionary catalog and capability discovery;
- exact, suggested, and later full-text lookup with explicit dictionary and
  language filters;
- bounded single or batch requests with cancellation, deadlines, pagination,
  and result limits;
- structured results containing the requested and normalized headword, match
  kind or score, stable dictionary identity, dictionary metadata, language
  metadata, article text, optional sanitized HTML, and typed resource
  references;
- provenance sufficient for an AI client to identify and cite the dictionary
  source and edition; and
- deterministic errors and partial-result reporting without hidden desktop
  state.

The installed API publishes hard limits for query text, filter counts, filter
size, and result count. The core rejects malformed UTF-8 and embedded NUL
bytes at the service boundary before dispatching work to a format adapter;
requested result counts above the published maximum are deterministically
clamped.

Dictionary content is untrusted data. The core and service adapter must not
execute embedded active content or interpret article text as instructions.
Transport adapters apply authentication, authorization, rate limits, request
budgets, logging, and protocol serialization outside `goldendict_core`.
